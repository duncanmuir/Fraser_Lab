Before running the pipeline the directory should be set up like:
basedir/PDB/

Inside each of these folders, you should have the PDB, MTZ file, cif files.

You can also set this directory up and download these files using wget_processing.sh

The pipeline consists of:

  1) Running refinement (refinement_runthrough.sh)
    **MAKE SURE TO UPDATE PHENIX PATH AND PYTHON PATH**
    -this runs refinement using 8 macro cycles and other parameters based on finalize.params file
    -there are also some validation scripts in there to look at the geometry of ligands. 
    -Parse_refine_log.py grabs some values from the log file including Rfree, Rwork
  
  2) Run ensemble refinement using grid search
    -this will produce an 9 folders named with each of the grid search parameters.
